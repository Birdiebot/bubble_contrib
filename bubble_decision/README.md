# Bubble decesion
This package maintains the decesion module in [Bubble](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble) project, This module controls the behavior of the robot by means of Finite State Machine(FSM).In the future, this module will be refactored. The module will use Decision Tree to control specific behaviors in the future. We have briefly written the logic for decision trees, but we do not use it in RMU2021.

This project is a part of Bubble. For more information on the project, please visit [Bubble-RoboMaster visual software stack based on ROS2](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble).

# About us
## About Bubble
Bubble is a ROS2-based open-source software stack made by the Birdiebot Team founded by the Mechanics and Science Innovation Base in Shanghai University of Engineering Science. Bubble provides a series of solution to the RMU related visual tasks.
## Author
Birdiebot is a school-level tech-innovation team oprated under the office of Academic Affairs in Shanghai University of Engineering Science. Supported by the Mechanics Innovation Base of Student Science and Technology Innovation Center, Birdiebot is committed to conduct technology innovation activities in robotics related affiars. We hope our work will encourage and promote new engineers for the robotics industry in China.
