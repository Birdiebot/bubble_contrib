# Bubble Predictor
This project maintains the aiming module in [Bubble](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble) project. The module analyzes the information and then outputs predictions to other packets, enabling to help the aiming on the armor of the power rune and outpost. See the Documentation section for specific algorithm implementation.

This project is a part of Bubble. For more information on the project, please visit [Bubble-RoboMaster visual software stack based on ROS2](https://github.com/Birdiebot/bubble).
